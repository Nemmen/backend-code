# folder structure -- in backend -- >
    when we have routes  like /users/123456 if we define all these routes in a single server it will hamper the readeability of the code 
    there for we create diffrent folder like route in which we have route defined and  controller folder - in which we have diffrent controller file for diffrent route which will have diffrent bussinuess logic  (any logic for expamle create a entity in an db when this url is hit or any request that come to do somthing) or other folder (like model folder)

    route mai ye define ki konsa route is controler se mapped hai.

    --> when a route is hit a function is run and the functioin is in the controoller folder . 

    stucture - model , working or function -> controler

    --> model folder -->  when we need to create/define a schema(structure of data) for database for specific route  is created in model 

    --> config folder --> every boilerpate  code related to server like port number, database connection etc are written here.

    // bad practice  to just write port nummber in listen

    // good practice make .env file and define the port number u will be using in it and other the server or backend depend like database url...

    // h.w create blog server
